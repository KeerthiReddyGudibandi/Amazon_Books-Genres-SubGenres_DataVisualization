# AmazonBooks-Genres,SubGenres
This project involves the analysis and visualization of a dataset containing information about Amazon books-genres, subgenres, including the book title, authors, main genre, subgenre, type, price, rating, and number of people rated. The goal is to present insightful visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can inform marketing strategies and drive sales. The primary objective of the project is to help stakeholders, such as publishers, book enthusiasts, and retailers, gain a better understanding of the book's performance in the market. Additionally, categorizing books by genre helps to track the popularity of fiction and non-fiction works, which is valuable for market segmentation and customer preference analysis. The visualizations allow users to explore top-rated books, compare pricing, and analyze the distribution of fiction versus non-fiction genres.
